# Changelog

## [0.3.2] - 2026-10-09

### Added

- Add a Dashboard page where you pin cards for any metric on Today, Yesterday or a date range, then drag or use the keyboard to arrange them; your layout is saved separately for demo and live data ([`377f41d`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/377f41d), [`37442cf`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/37442cf), [`6832b38`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/6832b38), [`9d6b41c`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/9d6b41c), [`502bf63`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/502bf63), [`91aa4ca`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/91aa4ca), [`6105328`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/6105328), [`9426f28`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/9426f28), [`3c2eab1`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/3c2eab1))

### Fixed

- Fix blood pressure showing only the systolic number: charts, tables, averages and baselines now show systolic and diastolic together, with both values on hover ([`21044fb`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/21044fb), [`6b0fd0b`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/6b0fd0b), [`d838c57`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/d838c57))
- Fix the AI Analyst claiming it has no data it could have looked up: it can now fetch any metric, workout, sleep night, blood pressure reading, lab result, medication dose, goal or report for any date or window, and it checks before saying something is missing ([`00fb88b`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/00fb88b), [`f286f1d`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/f286f1d), [`5f2069a`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/5f2069a), [`721e00e`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/721e00e), [`e6b8fc8`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/e6b8fc8), [`67b434b`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/67b434b), [`6babbd9`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/6babbd9), [`8e87200`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/8e87200), [`4527549`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/4527549))

## [0.3.1] - 2026-10-07

### Changed

- **Breaking:** connect Health Auto Export, Oura and Hevy in Settings instead of the environment: `HAE_API_URL`, `HAE_API_KEY`, `OURA_CLIENT_ID`, `OURA_CLIENT_SECRET`, `OURA_REDIRECT_URI`, `HEVY_API_KEY` and `HEVY_API_URL` are now ignored, so enter each once after upgrading; keys are stored encrypted with `VITAL_SECRET_KEY`, which `npm run db:init` now generates ([`87e8014`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/87e8014), [`8081d26`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/8081d26), [`9686e4c`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/9686e4c), [`8ed463f`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/8ed463f))
- **Breaking:** erase a data source's cached data, briefings and conversations as soon as you disconnect it, or delete the last lab report, instead of hiding them for seven days; the Removed sources panel and `VITAL_SOURCE_PURGE_GRACE_DAYS` are gone, and an upgrade or restart never erases anything ([`28346f3`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/28346f3), [`60d75f3`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/60d75f3), [`8a9a36f`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/8a9a36f))
- Fold Lab, Medications and Sleep under Health in the sidebar ([`ed096fc`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/ed096fc))

### Added

- Add body goals: set a target weight or body-fat percentage, optionally with your own pace, and read Body and Nutrition against it, with calorie and protein targets on Nutrition ([`a372b0c`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/a372b0c), [`7a793ad`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/7a793ad))
- Add data-quality checks to the data pipeline: doubled activity, duplicate readings, missing days, late-starting history and a stopped automation ([`f2297b7`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/f2297b7))
- Show only Settings on a first run in live mode until a source is connected and its data loads ([`2f183d5`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/2f183d5))

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-05

### Changed

- Keep Settings reachable when no live source is connected, so a ring-only setup can connect; other pages still show the "Live source unreachable" screen, now with an **Open Settings** link and no source named ([`12c634e`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/12c634e))
- List only the measures a connected source can provide in Settings → Data coverage and the Trends pickers, so Apple-only measures are no longer shown as "No data" when only a ring is connected ([`458d0d2`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/458d0d2))
- Show unknown workout calories as "not recorded" instead of 0 ([`dc34bcb`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/dc34bcb))
- Make VO2 max from Oura opt-in: add `heart_health` to `OURA_SCOPES` and reconnect to include it ([`eab74a4`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/eab74a4))

### Added

- Add Oura Ring as a live data source, alone or next to Health Auto Export: set `OURA_CLIENT_ID`, `OURA_CLIENT_SECRET`, `OURA_REDIRECT_URI` and `VITAL_SECRET_KEY`, then press **Connect** in Settings → Connections. It supplies sleep, breathing rate, steps, active calories, blood oxygen, heart rate and workouts; Oura's own scores are not shown ([`c004ce5`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/c004ce5), [`7c26456`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/7c26456))
- Add overnight HRV (RMSSD), lowest overnight heart rate and temperature deviation as separate ring measurements ([`7590c69`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/7590c69))
- Merge both sources under one stated rule: one source per measure per day, never added together, ring first for sleep and recovery (`OURA_PREFERRED_FOR` changes it) ([`30a59ce`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/30a59ce), [`efd6658`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/efd6658))
- Store the Oura login encrypted in Postgres, the only thing kept; no Oura reading is stored ([`41ceaa4`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/41ceaa4), [`c7b5489`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/c7b5489))
- Erase a removed source as if it had never existed: cached data, routes and briefings go at once, analyst conversations that used it are hidden at once and deleted after a grace period (`VITAL_SOURCE_PURGE_GRACE_DAYS`, default 7), and Settings lists removed sources ([`2657000`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/2657000), [`6f576c6`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/6f576c6), [`60fc9b7`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/60fc9b7))
- Record which sources fed each analyst answer ([`70aea49`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/70aea49))
- Add a per-source summary at the top of Settings → Data coverage ([`699f34e`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/699f34e))
- Document connecting Oura through an SSH tunnel when the browser is not on the Vital machine, and show Health Auto Export and Oura setup side by side in the README ([`45e6219`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/45e6219))

### Fixed

- Fix Oura scopes reported with a namespace (`extapi:daily`) being read as "not allowed", and one refused measure failing all the others and reporting a bad token ([`bbd6de3`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/bbd6de3), [`1f20d92`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/1f20d92))
- Fix a sleep recorded twice by one device counting twice: each wake-up day keeps one episode ([`f66892c`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/f66892c))
- Fix overlapping workouts from two apps counting twice ([`dc34bcb`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/dc34bcb))
- Fix one blood-pressure reading synced by two apps counting twice; readings from the same cuff are always kept ([`7eb08e2`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/7eb08e2))
- Fix the local Docker build packaging your `data/` folder, including lab PDFs, into the image; published images were not affected ([`e1a1119`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/e1a1119))
- Remove report values from source comments and tests, replacing them with invented ones ([`f22db9d`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/f22db9d))

## [0.2.4] - 2026-10-03

### Changed

- Bring the workout pages onto the graphite-and-indigo redesign ([`28eeabe`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/28eeabe))
- Name the map and place-search services in the trademark notice ([`d94b5cb`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/d94b5cb))

### Added

- Add Activity → Maps, maps of where outdoor workouts went, with a framing step, finer zoom and a preview of routes past the frame ([`0821dea`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/0821dea), [`7e9be67`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/7e9be67), [`abb1cbf`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/abb1cbf))
- Choose each map's tile provider, style and light or dark, label each map with its dates ending on "Today", and show a loading overlay while it reads its routes ([`5be1cce`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/5be1cce), [`c2f44b5`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/c2f44b5), [`7acccbf`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/7acccbf))
- Shade heart-rate maps cool to hot, and smooth frequency maps along the streets ([`b01f317`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/b01f317), [`dcb0766`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/dcb0766))
- Show the longest session on map cards ([`744d4fe`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/744d4fe))
- Add app icons and a web app manifest, so Vital can be added to a phone's Home Screen ([`cd4c30e`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/cd4c30e))
- Publish multi-architecture container images from CI, after testing and smoke-testing them ([`6cb4bc0`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/6cb4bc0))

### Fixed

- Fix walking heart rate, VO2 max, waist circumference, cycling distance and sodium not being read, by using Health Auto Export's names for them ([`417bf06`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/417bf06))
- Fix tapping a map highlight again not turning it off, map routes drawn at whole pixels, and uneven map borders in Safari ([`10b6f1f`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/10b6f1f), [`2cf9495`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/2cf9495), [`1b0fa04`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/1b0fa04))

## [0.2.3] - 2026-10-02

### Added

- Fetch health data on demand for the analyst and budget its fixed context, so long histories and lab results fit; `ANALYST_CONTEXT=ondemand` turns it on and full context stays the default ([`012140c`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/012140c))
- Add a Stop button and a guard that stops a model that cannot stop, so a runaway answer no longer spins indefinitely ([`eaadeba`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/eaadeba))
- License Vital under AGPL-3.0 and add screenshots and a trademark notice ([`1188b7d`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/1188b7d))

### Fixed

### Changed

- Show days and times in your timezone instead of UTC ([`a231c72`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/a231c72))
- Make Workouts the routine dashboard, with history on `/workouts/all` ([`0849fa0`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/0849fa0))
- Use one date-range control everywhere: 7, 30 or 90 days, plus a custom range ([`6b57a98`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/6b57a98), [`1868845`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/1868845))
- Name a data source only in Settings, dropping the coverage and source footers from pages ([`d991fcc`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/d991fcc))
- Show the analyst's answer as it forms and animate the wait for the first bytes ([`3c05d93`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/3c05d93), [`952ae77`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/952ae77))

- Evaluate progress with pluggable progression models, pause progress on deloads, and fall back gracefully when no workout source is connected ([`637e3c5`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/637e3c5), [`f6604d7`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/f6604d7), [`7a1d967`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/7a1d967))
- Let the analyst read and change the training plan with tools, and discuss a routine page in a dialog ([`10672e5`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/10672e5), [`cad2fe2`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/cad2fe2))
- Add workout sources as plugins, starting with Hevy, and name the source that also logged a session ([`8886db3`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/8886db3), [`7287f5a`](https://github.com/echupkin/vital/commit/7287f5a))
